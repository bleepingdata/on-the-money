# on-the-money
A home accounting database. For using with ANZ's personal banking exports (ANZ is a New Zealand bank).
- Export banking transactions to excel format (this is a manual step through ANZ online personal banking)
- Import these files (one-at-a-time) from Python to a Postgres database
- Categorise transactions into accounts and categories (this needs a lot of work)
- Visualise transactions (I use Metabase and Power BI, not included in project)

Developing using Visual Studio Code and DBeaver on macOS 10.13 / Win 10 using Python 3.6.5 (including Pandas and Anaconda) with Postgres 10.4.

The project is pre-alpha.
